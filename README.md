# [Electronic Circuit Simulation](https://www.gitbook.com/book/thomwright/electronic-circuit-simulation/details)


The following book is adapted from a chapter from my final year MEng project report at the University of York.

As a first pass I'll be copying the chapter more or less as-is into markdown format. Once all the content is there, I intend to improve it to make it more useful as an educational tool.

Knowledge of basic circuit theory, e.g. [Kirchhoff's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_circuit_laws) [laws](http://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/dccircuits/dcp_4.html), is assumed. For an introduction to circuit theory, consider Khan Academy's [video tutorials](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/physics/circuits-topic).

# Further Reading

If you want to learn more about circuit simulation, I highly recommend [Electronic Circuit & System Simulation Methods](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Electronic-Circuit-System-Simulation-Methods/dp/0071347704). At the time of writing, new paperbacks and ebooks are prohibitively expensive. Luckily there are some reasonably priced used copies available.
