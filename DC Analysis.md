# DC Analysis

*what is DC analysis?*

The fundamental equations used to describe a circuit in computer simulations are usually obtained by nodal analysis. Mesh analysis is an alternative, but automating the process is difficult [[ref](https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/Computer_Methods_for_Circuit_Analysis_an.html?id=7-6t1RJSGC0C&hl=en)], so its use is limited and nodal analysis is preferred.

## Linear DC Analysis

Using this technique, solutions for the DC voltage at every node for linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems can be easily calculated. Inductors are modelled as short circuits, capacitors as open circuits and AC sources set to zero to give a DC solution.
